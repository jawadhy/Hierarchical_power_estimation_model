*Abstract-* A detailed analysis of power consumption at low system levels becomes important as a means for reducing
the overall power consumption of a system and its thermal hot spots. This work presents a new power
estimation method that allows understanding the power breakdown of an application when running on
modern processor architecture such as the newly released Intel Skylake processor. This work also provides
a detailed power and performance characterization report for the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks, analysis of
the data using side-by-side power and performance breakdowns, as well as few interesting case studies.
